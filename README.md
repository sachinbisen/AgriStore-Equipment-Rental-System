## 🛠️ Salesforce Mapping (Phases)

# Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis  

## 📌 Requirement Gathering  
The goal of **AgriStore** is to provide a Salesforce-powered platform that digitizes agricultural equipment rentals.  

**Key requirements include:**  
- **Equipment Booking:** Farmers can browse, check availability, and book machinery.  
- **Rental Management:** Owners can list equipment, set rates, and track income.  
- **Inventory Management:** Managers can log maintenance and forecast demand.  
- **Reporting & Dashboards:** Insights into demand, revenue, and usage trends.  
- **Communication & Notifications:** SMS/Email confirmations, reminders, and feedback collection.  

---

## 👥 Stakeholder Analysis  
- **Farmers (End Users):** Book equipment, make payments, and provide feedback.  
- **Equipment Owners:** List equipment, manage availability, and track earnings.  
- **Rental/Inventory Managers:** Monitor bookings, update maintenance logs, and resolve conflicts.  
- **Government Officers / Higher Managers:** Analyze region-wise adoption, utilization, and support agricultural schemes.

## 🔄 Business Process Mapping  
1. Farmer searches for available equipment.  
2. Booking request created → system checks availability.  
3. Owner approves booking (if required).  
4. System auto-updates equipment status to *Not Available*.  
5. Farmer makes payment → booking confirmed.  
6. Equipment is used → usage recorded.  
7. After return, status resets to *Available*.  
8. Maintenance logs updated if needed.  
9. Feedback survey collected.  
10. Reports & dashboards generated for stakeholders.
